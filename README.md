Hi Everyone!

I've started to learn RoR couple days ago it is the reason why I want to attend to your workshops.
I live in Warsaw.

I had got huge problems with test and I coulnd't pass them even with internet, Hartl's book. I tried to do other tasks
and you can check it what I have done.
I want to add also that I have used first time the Heroku and it's ok :)
I realy want to join to workshops group.

Regards
